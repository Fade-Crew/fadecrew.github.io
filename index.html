            <p>Fade Crew (Stygian and others soon) develops tools that simplify real work—from game engines to general-purpose utilities. We ship a mix of free and paid projects built to solve problems without fluff.</p>
            <p>We're also the team(solo for now) behind <strong>Modern Football</strong>, a football experience that pushes far past the usual boundaries of the genre.</p>

            <div class="project-content">
                <p>Grid Core is designed to see what happens when you try new ideas without being afraid to break things. It's built on top of the amazing Godot Engine which we love. just exploring what else is possible with a fast starting point rather than spending precious time and losing hair trying to make our own.</p>

                <p>We made this because sometimes the best tool is the one that works exactly how <em>you</em> need it to. Grid is our playground for testing cleaner workflows, better UX, and tools that actually make sense when that light in your head is turned on.</p>

            <h2>Modern Football</h2>
            <div class="project-content">
                <p>A football experience that pushes far past the usual boundaries of the genre. Built to feel authentic, tactical, and alive in ways traditional football games don't even attempt.</p>

                <p>Modern Football is where we're testing what happens when you rebuild a sports game from scratch with no legacy baggage. Deep simulation, smarter AI, and gameplay that respects the sport instead of just copying what came before.</p>
