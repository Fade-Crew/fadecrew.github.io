            <p>Fade Crew develops tools that simplify real work—from game engines to general-purpose utilities. We ship a mix of free and paid projects built to solve problems without fluff.</p>
            <p>We're also the team behind <strong>Modern Football</strong>, a football experience that pushes far past the usual boundaries of the genre.</p>

            <div class="project-content">
                <p>Grid is basically Godot, but we've tweaked it (a lot) to see what happens when you try new ideas without being afraid to break things. It's built on top of the amazing Godot Engine—we're not trying to replace it, just exploring what else is possible.</p>

                <p>We made this because sometimes the best tool is the one that works exactly how <em>you</em> need it to. Grid is our playground for testing cleaner workflows, better UX, and tools that actually make sense when you're deep in a project at 2am.</p>

            <h2>Modern Football ⚽</h2>
            <div class="project-content">
                <p>A football experience that pushes far past the usual boundaries of the genre. Built to feel authentic, tactical, and alive in ways traditional football games don't even attempt.</p>

                <p>Modern Football is where we're testing what happens when you rebuild a sports game from scratch with no legacy baggage. Deep simulation, smarter AI, and gameplay that respects the sport instead of just copying what came before.</p>
